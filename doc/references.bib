 URL = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv3f8rb6},
 abstract = {One of the most cited books in mathematics, John Milnor's exposition of Morse theory has been the most important book on the subject for more than forty years. Morse theory was developed in the 1920s by mathematician Marston Morse. (Morse was on the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study, and Princeton published hisTopological Methods in the Theory of Functions of a Complex Variablein the Annals of Mathematics Studies series in 1947.) One classical application of Morse theory includes the attempt to understand, with only limited information, the large-scale structure of an object. This kind of problem occurs in mathematical physics, dynamic systems, and mechanical engineering. Morse theory has received much attention in the last two decades as a result of a famous paper in which theoretical physicist Edward Witten relates Morse theory to quantum field theory.Milnor was awarded the Fields Medal (the mathematical equivalent of a Nobel Prize) in 1962 for his work in differential topology. He has since received the National Medal of Science (1967) and the Steele Prize from the American Mathematical Society twice (1982 and 2004) in recognition of his explanations of mathematical concepts across a wide range of scienti.c disciplines. The citation reads, "The phrase sublime elegance is rarely associated with mathematical exposition, but it applies to all of Milnor's writings. Reading his books, one is struck with the ease with which the subject is unfolding and it only becomes apparent after re.ection that this ease is the mark of a master.?Milnor has published five books with Princeton University Press.},

    abstract = "{Redshift space distortions within voids provide a unique method to test for environmental dependence of the growth rate of structures in low-density regions, where effects of modified gravity theories might be important. We derive a linear theory model for the redshift space void–galaxy correlation that is valid at all pair separations, including deep within the void, and use this to obtain expressions for the monopole \\$\\xi ^s\_0\\$ and quadrupole \\$\\xi ^s\_2\\$ contributions. Our derivation highlights terms that have previously been neglected but are important within the void interior. As a result, our model differs from previous works and predicts new physical effects, including a change in the sign of the quadrupole term within the void radius. We show how the model can be generalized to include a velocity dispersion. We compare our model predictions to measurements of the correlation function using mock void and galaxy catalogues modelled after the BOSS CMASS galaxy sample using the Big MultiDark N-body simulation, and show that the linear model with dispersion provides an excellent fit to the data at all scales, 0 ≤ s ≤ 120 h−1Mpc. While the RSD model matches simulations, the linear bias approximation does not hold within voids, and care is needed in fitting for the growth rate. We show that fits to the redshift space correlation recover the growth rate f(\\$z\\$ = 0.52) to a precision of \\$2.7\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$ using the simulation volume of (2.5 h−1Gpc)3.}",

    abstract = "{We present a fast iterative fast Fourier transform (FFT) based reconstruction algorithm that allows for non-parallel redshift-space distortions (RSDs). We test our algorithm on both N-body dark matter simulations and mock distributions of galaxies designed to replicate galaxy survey conditions. We compare solenoidal and irrotational components of the redshift distortion and show that an approximation of this distortion leads to a better estimate of the real-space potential (and therefore faster convergence) than ignoring the RSD when estimating the displacement field. Our iterative reconstruction scheme converges in two iterations for the mock samples corresponding to Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey CMASS Data Release 11 when we start with an approximation of the RSD. The scheme takes six iterations when the initial estimate, measured from the redshift-space overdensity, has no RSD correction. Slower convergence would be expected for surveys covering a larger angle on the sky. We show that this FFT based method provides a better estimate of the real-space displacement field than a configuration space method that uses finite difference routines to compute the potential for the same grid resolution. Finally, we show that a lognormal transform of the overdensity, used as a proxy for the linear overdensity, is beneficial in estimating the full displacement field from a dense sample of tracers. However, the lognormal transform of the overdensity does not perform well when estimating the displacements from sparser simulations with a more realistic galaxy density.}",

The Eulerian approach we present here allows to calculate the higher-order moments of the initially Gaussian density and velocity fields: in particular, we compute the gravitationally induced skewness of the density and velocity-divergence fields for any value of Ω, confirming the extremely weak Ω-dependence of the skewness previously obtained via Lagrangian perturbation theory. Our results show that the separability assumption of higher-order Eulerian perturbative solutions is restricted to the Einstein-de Sitter case only.}",

This method is a combination of Barnes and Hut tree code and Particle-Mesh code. It combines the automatic inclusion of periodic boundary conditions of PM simulations with the high resolution of tree codes. This is done by splitting the gravitational force into a short range and a long range component. We describe the splitting of force between these two parts. We outline the key differences between TreePM and some other N-Body methods.},

This network is spanned by the galaxy locations that can be interpreted as a three-dimensional point distribution. The global properties of the point process can be measured by different statistical methods, which, however, do not describe directly the structure elements. The morphology of the large-scale structure, on the other hand, is an important property of the galaxy distribution. Here, we apply an object point process with interactions (the Bisous model) to trace and extract the filamentary network in the presently largest galaxy redshift survey, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We search for filaments in the galaxy distribution that have a radius of about 0.5 h−1 Mpc. We divide the detected network into single filaments and present a public catalogue of filaments. We study the filament length distribution and show that the longest filaments reach the length of 60 h−1 Mpc. The filaments contain 35–40 per cent of the total galaxy luminosity and they cover roughly 5–8 per cent of the total volume, in good agreement with N-body simulations and previous observational results.}",

	abstract = {We cross-match the two currently largest all-sky photometric catalogs—mid-infrared Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and SuperCOSMOS scans of UKST/POSS-II photographic plates—to obtain a new galaxy sample that covers 3π steradians. In order to characterize and purify the extragalactic data set, we use external GAMA and Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic information to define quasar and star loci in multicolor space, aiding the removal of contamination from our extended source catalog. After appropriate data cleaning, we obtain a deep wide-angle galaxy sample that is approximately 95% pure and 90% complete at high Galactic latitudes. The catalog contains close to 20 million galaxies over almost 70% of the sky, outside the Zone of Avoidance and other confused regions, with a mean surface density of more than 650 sources per square degree. Using multiwavelength information from two optical and two mid-IR photometric bands, we derive photometric redshifts for all the galaxies in the catalog, using the ANNz framework trained on the final GAMA-II spectroscopic data. Our sample has a median redshift of , with a broad reaching up to z > 0.4. The photometric redshifts have a mean bias of , a normalized scatter of σz = 0.033, and less than 3% outliers beyond 3σz. Comparison with external data sets shows no significant variation of photo-z quality with sky position. Together with the overall statistics, we also provide a more detailed analysis of photometric redshift accuracy as a function of magnitudes and colors. The final catalog is appropriate for “all-sky” three-dimensional (3D) cosmology to unprecedented depths, in particular through cross-correlations with other large-area surveys. It should also be useful for source preselection and identification in forthcoming surveys, such as TAIPAN or WALLABY.}

	Abstract = {LARGE-SCALE structure in the distribution of galaxies is thought to have evolved through gravitational instabilities from small density fluctuations in the (largely homogeneous) early Universe. This structure of galaxies consists of rich and poor clusters, connected by filaments and sheets, with regions largely devoid of galaxies (voids) in between1. Numerical simulations of the growth of initial density fluctuations through a nonlinear regime, motivated by the likely physics of the early Universe, also show a network of filaments and voids2,3,18, but the origin of this picture of filaments as the dominant structure was not well understood. Here we show that the 'web' of filaments that defines the final state in these simulations is present in the initial density fluctuations; the pattern of the web is defined largely by the rare density peaks in the initial fluctuations, with the subsequent nonlinear evolution of the structure bringing the filamentary network into sharper relief. Applying these results to the observed galaxy distribution, we suggest that 'superclusters' are filamentary cluster--cluster bridges, and we predict that the most pronounced filaments will be found between clusters of galaxies that are aligned with each other and close together.},

    abstract = "{The assumption that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales is one of the fundamental postulates of cosmology. We have tested the large-scale homogeneity of the galaxy distribution in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release One (SDSS-DR1) using volume-limited subsamples extracted from the two equatorial strips that are nearly two-dimensional. The galaxy distribution was projected on the equatorial plane and we carried out a 2D multifractal analysis by counting the number of galaxies inside circles of different radii, r, in the range 5–150 h−1 Mpc centred on galaxies. Different moments of the count-in-cells were analysed to identify a range of length-scales (60-70 h−1 Mpc to 150 h−1 Mpc), where the moments show a power-law scaling behaviour, and to determine the scaling exponent that gives the spectrum of generalized dimension Dq. If the galaxy distribution is homogeneous, Dq does not vary with q and is equal to the Euclidean dimension, which in our case is 2. We find that Dq varies in the range 1.7–2.2. We also constructed mock data from random, homogeneous point distributions and from lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM)N-body simulations with bias b= 1, 1.6 and 2, and analysed these in exactly the same way. The values of Dq in the random distribution and the unbiased simulations show much smaller variations and these are not consistent with the actual data. The biased simulations, however, show larger variations in Dq and these are consistent with both the random and the actual data. Interpreting the actual data as a realization of a biased ΛCDM universe, we conclude that the galaxy distribution is homogeneous on scales larger than 60–70 h−1 Mpc.}",
