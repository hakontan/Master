\section{DisPerSE-"Discrete Persistent Structures Extractor"}
In this work identification of the filamentary structure of the cosmic web in
data sets is crucial. To achieve this the code
DisPerSE\cite{2011MNRAS.414..350S}\cite{2011MNRAS.414..384S} is utilized. The
code is publicly available at \url{http://www2.iap.fr/users/sousbie/web/html/indexd41d.html?}.
DisPerSE is a code that was developed to identify topological features of the
cosmic web in cosmological particle distributions. DisPerSE utilized discrete
Morse Theory to identify the topological structures of the cosmic web in data
sets. In this section i will give a brief overview of how DisPerSE works to
identify the filamentary structure from a particle distribution. For a thorough
review i recommend the paper \cite{2011MNRAS.414..350S}, in which the following
chapter is based and much notation is borrowed, describing the theory behind DisPerSE and the
references therein.
\subsection{Morse-Theory}
To identify the features of the cosmic web from the density field of our
particle distribution, DisPerSE relies on Morse Theory \cite{Morse}. Morse
theory is a mathematical framework used to relate the geometrical and
topological properties of a function. In our case we utilize morse theory to
study the relation between the density field and topological features such as
filaments, voids and walls.
This is done by studying the gradient of a smooth function $f$. By studying the
gradient of the said function $f$, one can analyze the topological features of
the manifold. In general, to apply Morse theory one needs a smooth scalar function $f$
that is twice differentiable. In our case this scalar function is the density
field of our simulation volume. In Morse theory the gradient of the function $f$
is defined as $\nabla_xf(\vec{x})=df(\vec{x})/d\vec{x}$. This function
specifies the direction of steepest ascent for our scalar density function. The
points where $\nabla_xf=0$ are called critical points. These critical
points can be classified by studying the Hessian matrix of $f$ given as
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H}_f(\vec{x})=d^2f(\vec{x})/dx_idx_j.
\end{equation}
The critical points are classified by studying the eigenvalues of the Hessian
matrix. A critical point is of order $k$ when the Hessian matrix has exactly $k$
negative eigenvalues. This way one can classify the critical points as maxima
with $k=2$, saddle point with $k=1$ and a minima with $k=0$. This analysis also
implies that for morse theory to be applicable, the function $f$ has to satisfy
the condition $\mathcal{H}_f(\vec{x})\neq 0$ where $\nabla_xf=0$. From this it
follows that any function that satisfies this condition is called a Morse
function.\\
 
It is previously stated that the gradient points in a preferred direction for any non-critical
point. From the gradient one can therefore define integral lines between the critical
points. An integral lines is a parametrised curve $L(t)\in\mathbb{R}^n$ that satisfies
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dL(t)}{dt}=\nabla_xf(\vec{x}).
\end{equation}
These integral lines will always have critical points as their origin and
destination. An important property of these integral lines is that they cover
all of $\mathbb{R}^d$, but they never intersect eachother. They can however
share the same origin or destination. With these integral lines one can define
ascending and descending n-manifolds. If one consider a critical point $P$ of
order $k$ on the Morse function living in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we have an ascending manifold of
$d-k$ dimensions. This ascending manifold is constructed by the set of points reached by
all integral lines with origin at the critical point $P$. The descending
manifold is a $k-$dimensional region of space defined by all integral lines with
destination at point $P$. This leads to the definition of the Morse-complex.
The Morse complex is simply the set of all the ascending or descending
manifolds.\\
\subsection{Discrete Morse-theory}
The formality currently introduced deals with smooth continuous functions. This
however is rarely applicable to measured data or simulations. For an example the density field
of our simulation volume is derived from a discrete set of
point particles. Therefore discrete
Morse-theory\cite{FORMAN199890} is applied as to utilize Morse-theory on
discrete data. Instead of working on smooth functions discrete Morse-theory is
applied to what is called a simplicial complex. A simplicial complex is a space made up
of simplices. A simplex is a generalization of
a triangle to an arbitrary number of dimensions. For example a k-dimensional
simplex, reffered to as k-simplex, is represented as
\begin{itemize}
    \item a $0$-simplex is a point
    \item a $1$-simplex is a line segment
    \item a $2$-simplex is a triangle
    \item a $3$-simplex is a tetrahedron/pyramid etc.
\end{itemize}
A k-simplex will be denoted as $\sigma_k$ defined by the set of points
$\sigma_k=\{p_0, \dots,p_k\}$. Similarily one can define the face of a simplex
to be a subset of the original k-simplex. We can define the face as an
l-simplex $\gamma_l=\{p_0,\dots,p_l\}$ with $l\leq k$. If $\gamma_l$ is a face
of $\sigma_k$, then $\sigma_k$ is called a coface of $\gamma_l$. When $k$ and
$l$ only differs by one, a face is called a facet and a coface is called a cofacet. These simplices make up
what is called a simplicial complex in which a discrete Morse-function is
defined and discrete Morse-theory is applied. A simplicial complex $K$ are made
up of a finite set of simplices such that $\sigma_k\in K$. With this one can
define a discrete Morse-function $f$ as a function that maps a real value
$f(\sigma_k)$ for each simplex in the simplicial complex $K$. As for the
Morse-function defined in. regular Morse-theory, the discrete counterpart also has
to be differentiable and the gradient can only flow towards one preferred direction
locally. For this to occur and a Morse-function to be defined on the simplicial
complex it has to satisfy the following criteria
\begin{itemize}
    \item there exists at most one facet $\xi_{k-1}$ of $\sigma_{k}$ such
    that $f(\sigma_k)\leq f(\xi_{k-1})$, and
    \item there exists at most one cofacet $\chi_{k+1}$ of $\sigma_{k}$ such
    that $f(\sigma_k)\geq f(\chi_{k+1})$.
\end{itemize}
This criteria states that locally a simplex has a lower value than its facet and
a higher value than its cofacet. On a discrete morse function one defines a
gradient field. This is done by comparing a K-simplex with its facets or
cofacets. One can couple a K-simplex with its facets or cofacet and identify a
preferential flow direction through gradient pairs
\begin{itemize}
    \item If a simplex $\sigma_k$ has exactly one lower valued cofacet $\chi_{k+1}$, then
          $\{\sigma_k,\chi_{k+1}\}$ defines a gradient pair
    \item If a simplex $\sigma_k$ has exactly one higher valued facet $\xi_{k-1}$, then
          $\{\xi_{k-1},\sigma_{k}\}$ defines a gradient pair.
\end{itemize}
Gradient pairs define gradient arrows and define the preferred flow direction in
the discrete vector field. As for the regular Morse-theory, the discrete
counterpart also requires an analogy to a critical point. These are called
critical k-simplices. A k-simplex $\sigma_k$ is critical if the following
critera are satisfied
\begin{itemize}
    \item there exists no facet $\xi_{k-1}$ of $\sigma_{k}$ such
    that $f(\sigma_k)\leq f(\xi_{k-1})$, and
    \item there exists no cofacet $\chi_{k+1}$ of $\sigma_{k}$ such
    that $f(\sigma_k)\geq f(\chi_{k+1})$.
\end{itemize}
In regular morse theory the integral lines were crucial in representing the
manifolds in which the morse complex is defined. Their discrete counterpart
is what is called a V-path. If one considers k-simplexes $\alpha^i_k$ and
$(k+1)$ simplexes $\beta^j_{k+1}$, where $\alpha a^{i+1}_k$ is a facet of $\beta^i_{k+1}$, a
V-path is a strictly decreasing an alternating sequence such that
\begin{equation}
    \alpha^0_k, \beta^0_{k+1},\alpha^1_k,\beta^1_{k+1},\dots,\alpha^n_k,\alpha^n_{k+1}.
\end{equation}
Each pair ${\alpha^i_k,\beta^i_{k+1}}$ forms a gradient pair. A V-path is a set
of all continuous gradient pairs through the simplicials complex $K$.
With V-paths one can define discrete n-manifolds that make up the discrete
morse-complex. A discrete n-manifold is the set of k-simplices that belongs to a
V-path with either origin or destination at the critical simplex $\sigma_k$.
The n-manifolds are either ascending if their origin is $\sigma_k$. Likewise,
the n-manifolds are descending if ther destionation is $\sigma_k$. These
manifolds make up what is called the discrete Morse-complex.

\subsection{Delaunay Tesselation Field Estimator}
In order to compute a density field from a set of point particles, in which one
can compute the discrete Morse-complex, DisPerSE utilizes
Delaunay-tesselation\cite{2000A&A...363L..29S}. The Delaunay Tesselation Field
Estimator (DTFE) uses Delaunay triangulation. The Delaunay triangulation
divides the volume containing the particles into a set of triangles in 2D or
tetrahedrons 3D. The volume is divided such that no particle resides inside the
circumcircle of the assigned triangles. The vertices of the triangles are made
up of the point distribution and no particles reside inside the area or volume
of the triangles. This triangulation captures the density of the field in such a
way that if the triangles are small there are many particles close to eachother
and the density is high. Likewise larger triangles are made up of a point
distribution with a larger distance between the particles and the density is
lower. After assigning a density to each triangle, one can use linear
interpolation, assuming the density changes linearly between each bin, to assign
a density to all bins in the assigned computational grid.

\subsection{Topological Persistence}
When identifying the structures of the cosmic web from a density field derived
from a point distribution, one may
encounter noise. Structures not supposed to be significant may be inerpreted as
so and provide noise for later analysis. To deal with noise DisPerSE utilzies
persistence theory \cite{persistence}. Persistence theory studies the evolution
of what is called excursion sets. An excursion set, or a sub level set, is given as
\begin{equation}
    (x_1,\dots, x_n)\vert\rho(x_1,\dots, x_n)\geq\rho_0.
\end{equation}
This is the set of points $(x_1,\dots, x_n)$ where $\rho(x_1,\dots, x_n)$ is
larger than some threshold value $\rho_0$. Persistence theory measures the so
called lifetime of the excursion set. This is a measure of the absolute
difference in value between a pair of two critical points. By cycling through
values for $\rho_0$ one may measure the lifetime of the topological features.
One can imagine a function of one variable $\rho(x)$ with peaks and throughs as
mountains submerged under a water level set by $\rho_0$. This is illustrated in
figure \ref{fig:persistence}
When the whole function is submerged under water the excursion set is empty. As
the water level $\rho_0$ decrease the first highest peak of the function will
eventually become visible and a new component of the excursion set will start to
grow. Eventually the second peak will appear and a new independent component
will start to grow. These two components are independent of each other because,
as seen from above the surface of the water they are still separated. These two
components will grow untill the through separating the two peaks will become
visible. If the persistence of the pair is lower than a given threshold the two independent components of the excursion set will now merge
together and form a persistence pair. When two components merge one is
destroyed. In this case the second maximum is destroyed by the minimum as is
illustrated in figure \ref{fig:persistence}. Denne subseksjonen er uferdig
