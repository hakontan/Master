\chapter{Introduction}
The current dominating model for the universe is the $\Lambda CDM$ model. This model assumes that the mass-energy density of the universe is made up of three major components, namely dark energy $\Lambda$, cold dark matter CDM and regular baryonic matter. The modelling of the evolution and expansion of the universe is related to the mass-energy density of the universe itself. An important aspect of cosmology is therefore to constrain the bounds on these components in order to figure out how large the fraction of the total mass-energy density of the universe each of them make up.\\\indent
The leading expirements related to constraining cosmological parameters is the study of radiation remnant from the very early universe, namely the cosmological microwave background (CMB)\cite{1965cmb}, with the WMAP\cite{Wmap}- and Planck-satellites\cite{planckvi} in the forefront. Other studies include that of stellar supernova type-Ia explosions\cite{Pantheon}. Advances in cosmological experiments over the last decades has brought cosmology into the era of "precision cosmology", now that cosmological parameters can be constrained with sub-percent accuracy. This has lead to tensions in that certain experiments may disagree over values for cosmological parameters. An example of this is the Hubble tension in which measurements of the CMB disagree with that of type Ia supernovae when measuring the evolution of the Hubble parameter, in which quantifies the expansion of the universe. This particular tension could be a case of statistical fluctuation or systematic error, but these situations do warrant more independent experiments in order to strengthen the current knowledge.\\\indent Additional independent set of experiments relating cosmological components to observables can be found through studies of the distribution of matter in the universe, namely the large scale structure (LSS) of the universe. Studies of the large scale structure of the universe include the study of how matter is clustered at different cosmological redshifts in order to determine statistical properties of the matter distribution. On large scales the matter distribution in the universe form a web like pattern known as the cosmic web\cite{bondweb}. Substructures of the cosmic web include voids, empty regions of space containing little to no matter. These voids are bound by structures known as filaments. Filaments consists of gravitationally bound galaxy clusters. Studies like \cite{BeyondBAO}\cite{Nadathur_2020} have shown that the studies the statistical distribution of matter around voids is a useful addition to the current expirements for studying properties of the universe. In addition other studies like \cite{refId0} show that the statistical properties of galaxy clustering provides useful insight. \\\indent
One of the main statistical properties of the LSS that one can measure is the angular correlation function between definable physical objects. In short a correlation function in this context measures the excess probability over random that two objects are separated by a distance $r$. The fact that the universe is expanding\cite{Hubble168} causes light travelling towards us to be redshifted. With current reliable observational experiments, the only reliable way to observe the LSS is through observations of electromagnetic radiation. When observing objects in the universe, the redshifted light causes the observed matter distribution to appear distorted along the line of sight direction. Work on understanding the effects of redshift space distortions on the void galaxy cross correlation function has been conducted \cite{Nadathur_corr}. In addition the correlation function between matter has been studied theoretically\cite{peebles1980} and through observational experiments\cite{Eisenstein_2005}. The imprints of baryonic acoustic oscillations on the correlation between galaxy pairs\cite{pe00300h}, which appear as ripples in the density distribution of baryonic matter, serve as a standard ruler when measuring cosmological parameters.\\\indent
The filaments themselves have not yet received the proper treatment as that of voids and galaxy clusters. Although great efforts have been made analysing many of their properties\cite{Libeskind_2017}, their matter distribution has not yet recieved a thorough statistical review as that of voids and the matter distribution in general. Further contributions to this field includes proper modelling of the physical behaviour, such as the velocity field, of matter around filaments. Using data from the The Big MultiDark Planck simulation (BigMDPL)\cite{Multidark_dataset}, the first part of this work contains an analysis of filaments where the goal is to test a model for the velocity component of dark matter halos perpendicual to the filament spine. Using linear theory I will derive a simple model for the 
Current surveys of the large scale structure of the universe include the Sloan Digital Sky Survey \cite{Eisenstein_2011} in which the redshifts of $1.5$ million galaxies is measured. Future surveys include the Euclid mission, in which one of the scientific goals is to measure the redshifts upwards of $50$ million galaxies\cite{eucliddefinition}. In preparation for future experiments, like Euclid in which will greatly improve the data for which LSS studies are to be carried out on, simulation data is useful for testing and developing methodology. Current computer simulations enables the study of the evolution of billions of dark matter particles\cite{Millennium}\cite{Multidark_dataset} which allows for relatively accurate representations of the real universe.\\\indent
