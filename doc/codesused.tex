\section{DisPerSE-"Discrete Persistent Structures Extractor"}
In this work identification of the filamentary structure of the cosmic web in
data sets is crucial. To achieve this the code
DisPerSE is utilized.
DisPerSE is a code that was developed to identify topological features of the
cosmic web in cosmological particle distributions. DisPerSE utilized discrete
Morse Theory to identify the topological structures of the cosmic web in data
sets. In this section i will give a brief overview of how DisPerSE works to
identify the filamentary structure from a particle distribution.
\subsection{Morse-Theory}
To identify the features of the cosmic web from the density field of our
particle distribution, DisPerSE relies on Morse Theory \cite{Morse}. Morse
theory is a mathematical framework used to relate the geometrical and
topological properties of a function.
This is done by studying the gradient of a smooth function $f$. By studying the
gradient of the said function $f$, one can analyze the topological features of
the manifold. In order to apply Morse theory one needs a smooth function $f$
that is twice differentiable.
